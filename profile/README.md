# Crypto Quest

🚀 Welcome to Crypto Quest’s official GitHub!

We are a passionate team dedicated to building **fair, transparent, and verifiable** reward mechanisms for blockchain-integrated games. Our open-source projects empower developers and players alike by ensuring **integrity, security, and full auditability** in in-game reward distribution.

## What We Do

At Crypto Quest, we develop and maintain an open-source **Oracle** - a [deterministic reward distribution system](https://github.com/cqpbet/cqp-rewards) designed to:

- ✅ Allow **players** to verify reward calculations independently
- ❌ Prevent **developers** from manipulating prize placements
- 🔍 Ensure every action leaves a **traceable, reproducible record**


## Why Open Source?

We believe in the power of **community-driven development**. By making our reward mechanism open-source, we invite developers, security researchers, and gaming enthusiasts to **contribute, review, and enhance** our system. Together, we can set new standards for fairness in blockchain gaming.
